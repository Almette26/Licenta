    Salut, ma numesc Stoian Costin si sunt urmatorul Elon Musk!<br>
    Musk was born in Pretoria, South Africa, and briefly attended at the University of Pretoria before moving to
    Canada at age 18, acquiring citizenship through his Canadian-born mother. Two years later, he matriculated at
    Queen's University and transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he received bachelor's degrees in
    economics and physics. He moved to California in 1995 to attend Stanford University. After two days, he dropped
    out and with his brother Kimbal, co-founded the online city guide software company Zip2. In 1999, Zip2 was
    acquired by Compaq for $307 million and Musk co-founded X.com, a direct bank. X.com merged with Confinity in
    2000 to form PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002.
